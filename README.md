# ShapeIdentifier
## Developed to better understand computer vision 
Uses OpenCV for image recognition to identify and count the number of black circles, lines, squares, and triangles on a white background using the users webcam. Reduces noise and smoothes image through Gaussian blurring, detects and outlines edges, and detects the objects using contour identification.
